# Personalized-Messages-In-Bulk

# Purpose

This script was designed to allow people such as teachers, volunteer coordinators, event hosts, and managers to quickly generate personalized messages. For example, instead of writing, "This student has done an amazing job during this term!" or "Dear volunteer, ", this script, will allow you to simply just write your message ONCE and then when you list all your recipient's names, the script will generate your text and add it to a .txt file. 

# Instructions 

1. By default, this program will save your generated text to a file called "PersonalizedGreetings.txt". You will first be asked whether you would like to change the name of the file or not, if not, you simply add your greeting word. Examples) "Dear", "Hi", "Hey", "To", "Welcome", "Congratulations", etc.

2. Once you enter your greeting word, you will be prompted to enter your message. For example) "This is a friendly reminder that...", "Congratulations! You've been accepted to...", "Unfortunately our event...", etc. 

3. After that, you will be prompted to enter your farewell message. For example) "Sincerely, (Your Name)", "Take care.", "Best regards.", "Sorry for the inconvenience.", etc. 

4. You now simply just enter the names of all your recipients one by one.

5. When you are finished, simply type the word "SAVE" as one of the names. Yayyy, your generated messages are now saved in your file.

6. Check out your file and copy and paste your generated messages to your recipient's!

Note: You are NOT limited to the example greetings, example messages, and example farewell messages listed above, these are just some examples that you could use.

# Example result

Dear "Recipient's name",
