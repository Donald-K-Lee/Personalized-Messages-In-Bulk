# Personalized-Messages-In-Bulk

# Purpose

This script was designed to allow people such as teachers, volunteer coordinators, event hosts, and managers to quickly generate personalized messages. For example, instead of writing, "This student has done an amazing job during this term!" or "Dear volunteer, ", this script, will allow you to simply just write your message ONCE and then when you list all your recipient's names, the script will generate your text and add it to a .txt file. 

# Example result

Dear "Recipient's name", 

Thank you for volunteering at..., etc.

Sincerely, "Your name".
